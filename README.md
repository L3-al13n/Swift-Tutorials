# Swift-Tutorials
This is where i track my progress on learning Swift iOS
I am a product developer and Industrial designer. I am learning swift from scratch to develop and app for commercial use in my country. This tutorial will give me a solid foundation in doing just that. I would like to track my process to understand my thought process and identify my weaknesses.
